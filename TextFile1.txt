Application tracker to record how many resumes I sent out,
how many sent me an email to set up a 1st interview,
how many sent me an email for 2nd interview,
so on...,
ultimatley showing which one lead to a job.

I'd like it to visually demonstrate the number of each by category,
more than just a simple number.
Could do lines that connect to the different tiers, for example

																				   /---->  got the job!
															/----> third thru fith ____/
									 /----> second interview ----> rejection email
resume sent out ----> first interview ----> rejection email ___/
				\---> rejection email ___/
				 \----> no response

What code would I need to create a dynamic visualization that I can add to over time?

Need a database to store entries, application table, rows will need commpany name, 
for columns resumeID, first interview, second, third, rejection email, no response, etc.


CRUD functions to create instances, read features, update as things progress, delete...
will bulk functions be necessary? might be nice to have. I'll probably update as I go, 
and I dont see a scenario where I'll need to do more than a few at a time. 
I'll think about it more as things progress.

Do it in CA for more practice with the pattern

How will it connect to the front end, and what will I use to represent it visually?
Do some research on this
