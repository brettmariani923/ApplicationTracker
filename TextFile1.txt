Application tracker to record how many resumes I sent out,
how many sent me an email to set up a 1st interview,
how many sent me an email for 2nd interview,
so on...,
ultimatley showing which one lead to a job.

I'd like it to visually demonstrate the number of each by category,
more than just a simple number.
Could do lines that connect to the different tiers, for example

																				   /---->  got the job!
															/----> third thru fith ____/
									 /----> second interview ----> rejection email
resume sent out ----> first interview ----> rejection email ___/
				\---> rejection email ___/
				 \----> no response

What code would I need to create a dynamic visualization that I can add to over time?
